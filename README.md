# password-generator

>This application generates a random password for the user based on criteria that they decide.
>The Criteria are :
>* Length of password (between 8 and 128 characters)
>* Upper case letters
>* Lower cases letters
>* Numbers
>* Special characters

I started by making a function that the included code was already calling for that would result in populating the text bubble with the final password.  That function was called 'generatePassword'.

Within that function I execetued all possible steps to ensure the user selected valid criteria and gets a result that ends up with AT LEAST one of each criteria.

I outlined each step of my code with code comments that explain what each step of my code does!
